        <h2>Challenges & Learnings</h2>
        <p><strong>Random Level Generation:</strong> The different segments of the game are selected randomly, a significant amount of time was spent ensuring that the spacing between each segment was correct. Now I am more confident in creating a user-friendly system to create random level generation.</p>
        <p><strong>Animations:</strong> I implemented the animations for the main character and the antagonist. I had to work with the designer to ensure the speed of the animations were as intended. </p>
